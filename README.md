# Web Developer 2 at Stanford Application
* Name:   Gianna Nguyen
* Email:  giannatn@uci.edu

## Summary
I followed the ROAR developer guide.

## Found issues

* I had to change two lines from jsPsych.opts to jsPsych.options in config.js to get the initial app working.
* I had to comment out the firekit functions in config.js because they were throwing runtime errors.
* In the adding-a-single-stimulus section of "Writing Your Experiment", it is not highlighting all the correct values that should be changed to the catDogTrials variable. Line 98 instead of line 97 should be highlighted and line 106-112 should also be highlighted.
